title: "All Systems Failing!"

Beware the ides of March. But, also beware the dangers of snowboarding without having slept. Late in February I took a trip to Vermont but, it all went downhill after stepping in without enough rest. Needless to say I injured myself. Pretty badly as a matter of fact.

The final diagnosis remains to be determined although I have seen all too many doctors, paid all too many copays, and observed a variety of opinions and I've since exhausted my patience. Bottom line: I don't need surgery. Yippee. But I'm not zipping around just yet. Seems like it'll be a few months before I'm fully operation.

This has given me a lot of time to study when I might have otherwise been busy enjoying walking around or picking up a beer with my right hand. With seemingly endless idle time I figured it was a good idea to start working on one of my new year's resolutions. Which was to get a stronger understanding of [Rails](http://rubyonrails.com).

What makes this especially difficult is the fact that Rails is just a framework (an awesome one no doubt). But, that means it's fare to assume a proficiency in Rails is dependant on a proficiency in [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org). Being a noob with Ruby and knowing nothing at all about Rails you might expect me to start by reading a book or two. Maybe attend a workshop and watch some videos... After a couple days or weeks of immersing research perhaps I might try coding something simple to start like a blog, or possibly a todo list manager. But if you know me at all you might have picked up on the fact that I can't stand to wait for anything. I was feeling like I should have learned this years ago and there was absolutely no time to waste.

So, I decided to give myself a one week time frame outside of business hours whereby I create a production ready application with modern deployment techniques into a virtual private server. Pretty heavy for a first app. Oh, not to mention it would be used as an internal tool for my employer where by everyone has an individual account, preferences, and role based capabilities. One week... no knowledge of Rails. My colleagues gave me some helpful advice:

>"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1."

I found their lack of faith disturbing. I read and watched and listened and tried and failed and read some more and tried again and eventually I did it. I followed convention and the things is pretty damn performative. Even better it's actually useful. But holy shit did I complicate it. Git based deployment is one thing if you have no callbacks fired after a post-receive hook. But if you're bundling and precompiling assets from the pipeline after checking out a `Gemfile`, well damn, the permissions better all be in line. All difficulties aside I thoroughly enjoyed the process and have since built several other Rails apps.

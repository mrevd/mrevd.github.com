title: "Guy Walks Into a Bar"
---

So I'm at a bar not too long ago, when a confused gentlemen walks in. Behind the bar tender was a wall of whiskey. No less than several hundred different kinds were available. The place, On the Rocks, very clearly specializes in whiskey. It's a whiskey bar. This guy asks for a "whiskey on the rocks." I think it's a safe bet that most bars have a least two kinds of whiskey on hand. My knee-jerk reaction:

> What the hell man? Can't you see where you are? Why don't you just leave and stop wasting this man's time. *SMH*

But, it's not necessarily a stupid question despite how poorly it was posed. So the Bartender replies:

"Sure what kind would you like?"

"Oh I don't know a brown one, I know Jameson but if you can show me maybe..."

> EHMEHGERD

They both look at a wall of whiskey. Although maybe only one guy really looked.

"Tell you what, if you like Jameson you'll really like this."

Surprised by how cool the bartender was – even with a full house – I tried to relate. Following status quo, or meeting the bare minimum just isn't enough. At least not enough for the bartender, and not enough for me. But the bartender excelled where many of my colleagues in tech might have failed, and where I know I have failed many times. Sharing knowledge is the key although sometimes not appropriate.

In this scenario the gentlemen clearly had no understanding of whiskey, yet had placed an order and expected service. The bartender could have explained to him that whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. And that different types of grain are used for different types of whiskeys. And then polled him further to find out what kind of flavors he likes to compare it to the types of grain used in some of his available stock. Instead, he created his best proposal for his client based on what he already knew about this person.

It's my job to not only design and develop new technology for our clients, but to explain to them why it tastes better – even if to them it tastes the same. If they need to have an understanding of HTML before moving to sever side, that's my job too. Knowing when to explain the origins is a difficult part of this task. Here's an example.

Let's say I've taken an archaic system that writes new form entries directly into a text file as a means of storing information. Now let's say I just replaced that system with a relational database that backs itself up daily and includes a web based reporting interface that requires no programming knowledge to operate.

> What is a relational database, how does this improve me life? Can I scan it with my QR reader? Can I download it?

Remember, the client didn't know whiskey was made of grain. In order to prove this tastes better I find it's easier to accentuate the improvements through demonstration – an actual use case. It's hard enough to write the code, now to explain it in English...

The guy was ultimately dissatisfied. Apparently he didn't like whiskey at all. Another drink down the drain. But we'll continue to concoct more, whether they appreciate it or not. Because no one prides themselves in fixing the same drink everyday.

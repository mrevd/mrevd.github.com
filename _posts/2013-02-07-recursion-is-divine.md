title: "Recursion Is Divine"
---

An old friend of mine used to like to say that recursion is divine. A recursive process is a process that repeats itself  which is a very powerful ability in computing. But while impressive I was draw to other aspects of the science. For a long time I clung to the fact that computer science is mainly logic. To this day I very much appreciate that fact. However, I've come to appreciate the creative side of this field more and more with experience. I've diligently studied languages, math and computer science for many years. Although I'd be hard pressed to call myself a mathematician, or a master of linguistics, I do consider myself a polyglot and computer scientist without a doubt.

It's easy to find the beauty in languages. And while math is commonly referred to the universal language it's fair to say that it's beauty can be overshadowed by it's complexity. Before learning a strong understanding of the language itself I found myself obsessing over the grammar, syntax and semantics of math. Dissecting *how* things were said seemed more interesting than *what* things were said, or at least easier to grasp.

Consider for a moment that there are varying degrees of infinity. Don't take my word for it, read up on Cantor. To say it plainly, there are infinitely many infinities greater than infinity. English just isn't well suited to articulate these sorts of things. Part of the beauty of math is that you don't need English to explain it.

    for any set A, |P(A)| > A

Basically, the set of all subsets or powerset of a set is greater than that set. The explanation of the proof while very interesting is a bit outside the intended scope of this post. Before having an understanding of the proof of this theorem consider how eloquent the line above is. It's the concise manner in which this complex concept is articulated, its brevity. That's what's so fascinating about linguistics. It's efficiency embodied. This is one of the artistic sides of computing. So, while it seemed like a logical field to pursue it turns our I'm sticking around for it's beauty.

Before we understand our native languages we speak words in that language. Eventually, we're not just mimicking and we start to actually articulate concious thought. It's the difference between the ability to concatenate isolated words and the ability to articulate fluid expressions. Whether writing C#, Python, French, or Chinese, the learning processes is occurs in this manner. To my surprise I found that the beauty in learning math or computer science is that it is a means of expression, a creative outlet. And, for that reason I'll strive to remain teachable and open minded.

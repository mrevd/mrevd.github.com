title: "Recursion Is Divine"
---

An old friend of mine used to like to say that recusion is divine. For a long time clung to the fact that computer science pure logic. To this day I very much appreciate that fact. However, I've come to appreciate the creative side of this field more and more with experience. I've diligently studied languages, math and computer science for many years. Although I'd be hard pressed to call myself a mathematician, or a master of ligustics, I do consider myself a polyglot and computer scientist without a doubt.

It's easy to find the beauty in languages. And while math is commonly reffered to the universal language it's fair to say that it's beauty can be overshadowed by it's complexity. Before learning a strong understanding of the langauge itself I found myself obsessing over the grammar, syntax and symantics of math. Disecting *how* things were said seemed more interesting than *what* things were said.

Consider for a moment that there are varying degrees of infinity. Don't take my word for it, read up on Cantor. To say it plainly, there are infinitely many infinities greater than infinity. English just isn't well suited to articulate these sorts of things. The beauty of math is that you don't need Enlish to explain it.

    for any set A, |P(A)| > A

The explaination of the proof while very interesting is a little outside of the intended scope of this post. The beauty of the language may overshadow the beauty of the science at first. In order to have a true understanding of the theorem, knowledge of both aspects are required. Before we understood our native language we speak words in that lanuage. Eventually, we're not just mimicking sounds be actually speaking. For me and math it was similar but in computer science it was exactly the same.
